// Tree traversal
// Given any tree, How do we visit any node, once?
// Remember, trees can be unsorted.
// What would our path be to visit each node once? What's the most efficient path?

// Two Main Ways to Traverse a tree
//  1) Breadth-first Search (Horizontal approach, Breadth is across childrens, at each lower level, look to all children at that level)
//  2) Depth-first Search (Vertical approach)
//      a. in order
//      b. pre order
//      c. Post Order
