// array.sort()
// Works well with strings but numbers don't get sorted in a way that makes sense.
// That's because the default way to sort is by Unicode Code for the element!

// So, you can actually tell JS how to sort, accepts an optional comparator function
// comparator looks at pairs of elements (a and b), determines their sort order based on the return value
